## Good things about code

Below are some of the good things I noticed about the code.

- [Coded with a Design Pattern](#).
- [Functional Programming](#).

## What was missing and was updated

- [Route Model Binding ( Saves much of the boiler code )](#).
- [Type Hinting ( Function arguments and return values ) helps providing and returning only relevany data](#).
- [Redundant Code was removed](#).
- [Irrelevant Variable Declarations](#).
- [Proper Naming of variables](#).
- [Added Form Request](#).
- [Added Trait for repetitive code usage ( Sending JSON responses )](#).
- [Added repetitive code to functions](#).
- [Added Eager Loading for optimized performance](#).
- [Added Global Helper](#).

## Conclusion

Overall the code was simple and easy to understand. Except one or two function of controller all other made controller lean.
Code was outdated, had some deprected functions. Was written on and older PHP version.

Eager Loading, route model binding, moving business logic to a central place, proper naming convention and removing unnecessary variable
declarations made code look and perform alot better.
